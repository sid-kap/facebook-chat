# facebook-chat

Simple Haskell bindings to the Facebook Chat API.

This library is very unfinished at the moment.

A huge amount of credit is due to the authors of https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat and https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api, from which most of the API functions in this library were copied.
